				<p> Emperor Obama has recently decreed the necessity for the empire to build a "Death Star" as it has been named by the pundits.
				</p>
				<p>The recent spending increase on ships capable of destorying planets has sky rocketed over the page few years as Obama seized control of the the senate and the executive. 
				</p>
				<p>Emperor Obama was quoted stating "The rebel faction must be erradicated, they threaten peace and stability in our empire, and we must crush them with over whelming force". Obama proceed to answer questions from the Empire's Press Corps, though all in attendence were relatively muted due to the Emperors recent tactic of choking all members of the press who speak.
				</p>
				<p> We have come to a precipus in our empire where we must either choose between inter-planetary weapons capable of destroying worlds, or using resources for far more noble things like education and Inter-glactic trade agreement. Have we come to the point where it's time we moved on to another dictatorial Sith Lord? Should we even be considering these Jedi's anymore with their "force". The religious right have had a choke-hold on this nation for to long.
